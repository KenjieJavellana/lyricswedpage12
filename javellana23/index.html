<p>[Verse1] <br>
      You'll be safe 
     in <br> my romance, babe, uh<br>
Label's fading but <br>
I see you cravin' for more <br>
You're denying it <br>
But you ain't controlling your actions <br>
Keep me guessing but <br>
Don't keep me waiting for us <br>
Oh,<br> (Chorus) <br I live to appreciate you<br>
Take all the love that I give<br>
All that I wish is for you to take me<br>
But I taste the lies on your lips <br>
I count the days when we're in love<br>
'Cause I only matter when he's not around <br>
Oh, but I live to appreciate you <br>
Take all the love that I give, mhm <br>
 Got my heart on my sleeve<br>
 I'm beggin' the heavens to be good to me<br>
 Are you obsessive love?<br>
 'Cause I'm tolerating all of your desires<br>
 I'll keep you wanting me more, ooh<br>
 Leave but I'll keep you comin'<br>
 I'm sure it's my love that got you suffocated<br>
 Oh, I live to appreciate you<br>
 Take all the love that I give<br>
 All that I wish is for you to take me<br>
 But I taste the lies on your lips<br>
 I count the days when we're in love<br>
 'Cause I only matter when he's not around<br>
 Oh, but I live to appreciate you<br>
 Take all the love that I give, mhm<br>
 Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh<br>
 Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh<br>
 Take all the love that I give<br>
 All that I<br>
 You come over but not too often<br>
 You don't visit 'cause you got more options<br>
 You come over but not too often<br>
 You don't visit 'cause you got more options<br>
 Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh<br>
 Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh> </p>
